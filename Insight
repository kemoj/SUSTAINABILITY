 The variables considered for prediction include 'Global_active_power', 'Global_reactive_power', 'Voltage', 'Global_intensity', 'Sub_metering_1', 'Sub_metering_2', 'Sub_metering_3', and a calculated 'power' variable. The target variable being predicted is 'Global_active_power'.

Several regression models were used and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, and XGBoost. Based on the evaluation metrics (MAE and MSE) on the testing set, the Random Forest model appears to be the best performer with the lowest MAE (0.0013) and MSE (0.0000). The predicted vs actual graph shows the relationship between the true values of 'Global_active_power' and the values predicted by the best model. A plot where the points cluster closely around a diagonal line indicates that the model's predictions are close to the actual values, suggesting good performance. Conversely, points scattered far from the line indicate larger errors in prediction.

 In Summary, both weather and previous electricity consumption history are valuable for predicting electricity consumption. Based on the variables used in this analysis, which includes features like 'Voltage' and 'Global_intensity' (which can be influenced by weather) and 'Sub_metering' values and 'Global_active_power' from the consumption history, it's likely that a combination of both provides the best predictive power. However, previous electricity consumption history is generally a stronger indicator of future consumption patterns due to the inherent temporal dependencies and behavioral aspects of energy usage.
